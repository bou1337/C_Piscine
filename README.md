# 42 Piscine

This repository contains my solutions for the 42 School Piscine, a month-long intensive coding bootcamp focusing on the fundamentals of C programming and problem-solving. It includes exercises and projects from modules `C00` to `C08`.

## Contents
The repository covers the following modules:

### C00 - Introduction to C
- Basics of C syntax
- `printf`, `scanf`, and basic operations
- Writing and compiling simple C programs

### C01 - Pointers and Memory
- Understanding pointers
- Basic memory manipulation
- Function parameters and return values

### C02 - Strings and Arrays
- String manipulation functions
- Array operations
- Implementing basic library functions like `strlen` and `strcpy`

### C03 - More on Functions and Loops
- Advanced use of loops
- Writing custom utility functions
- Implementing simple algorithms

### C04 - Recursion
- Understanding recursive functions
- Implementing recursion-based algorithms

### C05 - More on Pointers and Memory
- Dynamic memory allocation
- `malloc`, `free`, and managing memory

### C06 - File I/O
- Working with files in C
- Using `open`, `read`, `write`, and `close`

### C07 - Advanced Algorithms
- Sorting and searching algorithms
- More complex problem-solving techniques

### C08 - Linked Lists
- Creating and managing linked lists
- Implementing basic list operations (add, remove, search, traverse)

## Usage
To compile and run any of the exercises, navigate to the corresponding directory and use `gcc`:
```sh
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror filename.c -o output
./output
```
